# Decision-Bottleneck-Simulator-Turning-Hiring-Delays-into-Data-Insights
> Self-initiated project exploring how hiring delays translate into real financial impact, quantifying decision bottlenecks across the talent pipeline.

## TL;DR
**Problem:** HR teams often underestimate the true cost of hiring delays, each day a vacancy stays open increases lost productivity and revenue opportunity.

**Process:** Using synthetic HR operations data, I analyzed hiring timelines, cost of vacancy, and SLA adherence to identify delay drivers. Then, I modeled potential cost savings if key stages improved by 10-30%

**Result:** 
* Each day of delay costs ~$4.8K per role
* 56% of roles breached SLA timelines
* Sales & Engineering faced the highest cost of delay
* Improving decision speed by 20% could save ~$1,000 per role

## Key Highlights
* **Correlation Analysis:** Identified strongest delay-cost links, offer approval & interviews.
* **Bottleneck Detection:** Operations, HR, and Sales were top departments affected.
* **SLA Analysis:** Over 50% of requests missed timelines.
* **Impact Simulation:** Modeled savings potential using Python for 10%, 20%, and 30% delay reductions.

 ## Tools Used 
 * **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib):** Data cleaning, analysis, and impact simulation
 * **Excel:** Data verification & structure validation
 * **Jupyter Notebook:** Visualization and documentation

## Business Insight 
Even small improvements in approval turnaround and interview scheduling can lead to measurable financial gains. Streamlined hiring isn't just faster, it's more cost effecient and scalable.

## What This Project Demonstrates
* Ability to connect HR operations metrics to financial outcomes
* Experience in Python-based analytics and process modeling
* Understanding of SLA, time-to-fill, and cost-of-delay frameworks
* Business storytelling with measurable impact
